The aim is to implement an efficient and user-friendly interface, therefore users can view all washing machines and dryers in their dormitory and get fun responses of their facial emotion . We specified functional and nonfunctional requirements, and then use WeChat develop toolkit and python to implement.  With the test, we fixed bugs and let the final result meet our requirements.
